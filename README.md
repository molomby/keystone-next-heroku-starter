# Keystone Next on Heroku

A Keystone Next example/starter project for Heroku deployments.

This repo can be [deployed to Heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/molomby/keystone-next-heroku-starter) directly,
fork it to [run it locally](#local-dev) or use it as a basic [starter project](#starter-project).

## App Features

The app Keystone schema is a mix of the Keystone Next
[todo](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/todo) and
[auth](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/auth) example projects.
It demos a number of Keystone features, including:

- Some lists to play around with
- Password based authentication
- Stateless sessions
- Initial user creation workflow
- Admin UI
- GraphQL endpoint (`/api/graphql`), inc. GraphiQL (when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`)
- Access control
- Automatic migrations (via. [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate))

## Local Dev

This codebase can be run locally by cloning it to your dev environment.
On MacOS you'd perform the following steps:

```sh
# Install postgres (if you don't have it already)
# This will add a DB role matching your OS username
brew install postgresql

# Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/molomby/keystone-next-heroku-starter
cd keystone-next-heroku-starter

# Install node packages
yarn

# Start the app
# A DB will be created automatically and migrated to the latest schema
yarn dev
```
Then point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Starter Project

If you want to use this codebase as a starting point for your own app, begin by [forking it](https://github.com/molomby/keystone-next-heroku-starter/fork) into your own account.
Then, clone that repo to your dev machine using the [local dev](#local-dev) steps above.

### Deployment

The "Deploy to Heroku" button at the top is fun but it doesn't set you up for repeated deployments.
The following process (for MacOS) creates, configures and deploys a Heroku app from scratch using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
# Get the Heroku cli (if you don't have it already)
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku

# Authenticate (follow the prompts)
heroku auth:login
```

Run these next steps from your codebase root, substituting `molomby-keystone-next-starter` for a unique name key for your app:

```sh
# Create the new app and configure a free postgres addon
heroku create molomby-keystone-next-starter --addons=heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

# Adding a SESSION_SECRET env var will allow sessions to persist between dyno restarts
heroku config:set SESSION_SECRET=$(head -c30 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9' | head -c30)

# This previous step will also have configured a remote for your local git repo called "heroku"
# Deploy your latest commit by pushing a branch to it
git push heroku main
```

You'll see the build process output, then your app will appear online.

### Migrations

The first time you run `yarn dev` locally Keystone will create a local development database with the initial schema.

To extend this database schema, simply make your changes to the Keystone lists in `schema.ts` and re-run `yarn dev`.
Keystone will detect these changes, prompt you to create a migration and apply the changes to your local database.
Eg:

```
✨ There has been a change to your Keystone schema that requires a migration

✔ Name of migration … Adding person.country field
✨ A migration has been created at migrations/20210514023215_adding_person_country_field
✔ Would you like to apply this migration? … yes
✅ The migration has been applied
```

Your changes will then be reflected in the Admin UI and GraphQL API.

Behind the scenes, this magic is being performed by
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate)
which generates SQL migration scripts based on your code changes.
You can find these files in the `/migrations` directory.

Committing these migration scripts to GitHub will cause the migration to be run when your app is next deployed.
Adding your own SQL scripts to the directory will also work, just follow the directory naming convention –
migrations are applied based on their order on disk.
This can be useful for importing data or DB operations beyond the scope of Keystone.

### Seed Data

The ability to add arbitrary SQL migrations lets you seed data into your database somewhat easily.
Create a SQL file with some insert commands and place it in an appropriately named directory within `/migrations`.

Data added in this way will be applied to any databases created when a new collaborator clones the repo and first runs `yarn dev`.
Having a fake but realistic set of data, automatically inserted when a DB is created, can also be very useful for automated testing.

## KeystoneJS

Keystone is a powerful GraphQL based headless CMS.
Written in TypeScript, it has some terrific features out of the box, is easy to extend and a joy to use.

This app is build on an early preview build of Keystone Next.
We have some exciting plans for the project, with lots of features and docs rolling out over the next few months, as we move toward production readiness.
